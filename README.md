## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing data from the Discogs Python API, [python3-discogs-client](https://github.com/joalla/discogs_client/), as well as different data visualizations using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

Plotly charts by default do not render properly in Github's preview of Jupyter Notebooks, so PNGs of each chart are provided. I recommend viewing this notebook on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/madroscla/discogs_collection/blob/main/discogs_collection.ipynb) to properly see and interact with each visualization.
